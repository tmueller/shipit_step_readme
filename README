NAME
    ShipIt::Step::Readme - Automatically create README for your Perl Package
    before releasing

VERSION
    Version 0.03

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Build install

SYNOPSIS
    Just add it to the ShipIt config, after all steps, that edit Pod,
    because the README file is generated from the Pod of the distris' main
    file.

        steps = FindVersion, ChangeVersion, ChangePodVersion, Readme, ...

    And make sure you have a VERSION or a NAME section in your Pod. The
    README pod, which is not visible on CPAN, is added after any of them.

DESCRIPTION
    This ShipIt::Step autogenerates a README-file from your distris' main
    package.

    Therefore it adds a Pod INSTALLATION section, but only if it does not
    exist yet. It contains installation instructions, for either an
    installation via ./Build or an installation via make, depending on the
    existence of a Build.PL or a Makefile.PL. If neither is found, we die.

    The Pod INSTALLATION section is added after the Pod VERSION section, or
    in case it does not exist, after the Pod NAME section. If neither is
    found, we die. This section won't be visible on CPAN, and will only
    appear in your README.

    Run this after any ShipIt::Step, that edits Pod. For example
    ShipIt::Step::ChangePodVersion does that to add a Pod VERSION section to
    your module. Otherwise the changes made won't be reflected in your
    README.

CONFIG
    Nothing to configure. Drop me an EMail if you have any wishes for
    configuration.

WARNING
    This is not really tested with distris, which dont't use Build.PL. But
    from a logic point of view, there shouldn't be any problem. However,
    contact me if you encounter any problems.
